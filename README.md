# Bouncingball
Have you ever wondered what 100 bouncy balls falling into a box would look like in slow motion?

Bouncing ball is a small physics simulator that simulates an arbitrary number of balls of varying size and mass in a closed space. Collisions with walls and between balls are accurately modelled with variable elasticity. 
The project grew from previous physics simulation projects in Python and a desire to learn basic OpenGL

## Usage
```bash
python bouncingball.py
```
For fullscreen mode
```bash
python bouncingball.py -f
```

## Dependecies
* Numpy
* OpenGL
* Pyglet
